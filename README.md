Project test my understanding of how to implement a given flowchart into code, you're at first required to build a simple calculator which later on is 
going to motivate users to try and do the math themselves by becoming more and more honest with them. For example, if they need to do calculations with 
multidigit numbers, that, okay, might be tricky, so the calculator won't be very hard on them and just solve it. However, if the equation is a simple sum 
of two integers like 2 + 3, maybe it should suggest solving it themselves. Even worse, if it's multiplication by one or zero, that is just of the line! 
It is command line program that solve basic math operations that are substraction, addition, multiplication and division.

You need to enter the equation in the following format after start the program: 

Ex: "8 + 2", "8 / 2", "8 * 2", "8 - 2". Do not include quotes.
